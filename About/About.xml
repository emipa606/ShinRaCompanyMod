This mod aims to bring the ShinRa company (Final Fantasy 7 1997) things (Uniforms,Armors,Weapons,Resources,Buildings,Implants, and others) to Rimworld.

Warning: the mako processor can turn your map to a wasteland, deconstruct it for map to regenerate.
	
There are some things like the robots that are removed on 1.1 and 1.0  due to errors, they will come later again.
